# Southside Barbers

This is a simple website for a fictional barbershop. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a responsive website that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Getting Started

I built it, but we all need help out here getting started.
Consider this a fleshed-out salon template.
If you'd like to use this as a template, you can simply clone this repository:

```
git clone <repo url>
cd southside-barbers
```
